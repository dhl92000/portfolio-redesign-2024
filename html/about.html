                        Hi, I'm Dahee!
                    </p>
                    I am a fullstack engineer that is fascinated by both frontend and backend development.
                    <p>
                        I joined a major airline in 2016 and became addicted to travelling and exploring new places.
                        After
                        developing a knack for connecting with customers and an interest in the Toronto real estate
                        market,
                        I started my own business
                        as a real estate salesperson. I was able to build a clientele of repeat clients and referrals,
                        creating a marketing
                        plan and online
                        presence, and everything in between.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        While I was working in both industries, I found myself wondering how to improve the technologies
                        my
                        clients
                        were
                        using. There was a trend for minimal user interfaces, but some clients who were more senior had
                        a
                        lot of
                        trouble
                        using these. Similarly, at the airport, I would witness passengers staring blankly at the
                        self-check-in
                        terminals, not knowing what to do.
                    </p>


                    <p>
                        This intrigue into how these applications were made was where my transition to a career in
                        software
                        development started and I have been programming ever since.
                    </p>
